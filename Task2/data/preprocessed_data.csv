there is actually an objective reason for dating the provincial map 125 or thereabouts it is at this time that the location of most 80 auxiliary regiment are known a the majority of surviving military diploma date from hadrian s rule it s not entirely clear why by 180 most auxiliary troop had roman citizenship all after 212 so diploma which were certificate of citizenship were no longer issued earlier it is possible that diploma were normally issued in paper form unless the recipient specifically requested and paid for a metal one rather than a a metal tablet and so were eliminated by organic decomposition also before 107 the empire did not include dacia and so wa not at it fullest extent ignoring the two year occupation of mesopotamia under trajan of course the auxiliary issue is only relevant to the provincial map where we would show the auxiliary regiment and not to the overall empire map where we don t ideally we would have the same map a 125 for 30 bc augustus start ad 14 augustus end 54 claudius end annexation of britannia thracia mauretania 75 new flavian legion 211 severan legion and 284 loss of dacia and agri decumates these map would not take long to make a most of the detail would be the same a the existing one the only substantially different one would be augustus start 30 bc when the empire wa much smaller if you can reproduce goldsworthy s graphic using inkscape then it really would be worth the effort to learn how to do it because then we could produce some really attractive map of all battle not just strasbourg instead of the ugly line diagram that we have to put up with now your other project look interesting i trust that they will all be physical map i think we have traveled a long way from the useless political map that you used to make tuo andrea,0,0,0,0,0,0

umm i m not exactly promoting him i m a democrat and i voted for gore but the consensus of several user in fact every user except you wa very clearly in favor of the quote being removed from the introduction the quote provides no context is blatantly pov not to mention terribly inaccurate and silly considering what actually happened with the election fraud see http www commondreams org views04 1104 36 htm and the fact that gore actually won anyway so how did he make dubyah the president yes i m aware that s the first thing many people think of when they see him just a the first thing many people think of when they see mama ca is that she died choking on a ham sandwich this like the quote is not true at all but merely an ill researched fallacy doe this mean we should write in ca introduction that she is best known for having choked on a ham sandwich no because it simply isn t factually based or accurate at all even if it wa accurate it still wouldn t be appropriate for the introduction a it provides no context pretend you are someone who didn t know anything about him and you saw this quote that he made george w bush the president what would that mean is he the magical fairy who go around granting wish and making people president with his magical fairy wand from lollypopland you need to provide context and a detailed account of what actually happened before you provide such a glib not to mention factually inaccurate summary a i said before i ve reviewed toe umbrella chacha s edits and none of them appear to be vandalism but a pretty good faith attempt at removing something which not only constitutes a huge violation of npov policy but also violates the consensus a reached on this talk page month ago so again i don t know what your point is about that user being banned when the offense seems to be only the fact that they removed vandalism well over 3 time to me your offense of violation of npov violating consensus when no one agrees with you and editing other user s sigs seem a twinkle more extreme than theirs i invite everyone to look at the comment that griot left on astruc s talk page wherein he revealed his very clear bias on this issue he accused nader of being a maoist and he is clearly just using wikipedia a his own personal coloring book to slander him in violation of npov policy and in violation of an irrefutable consensus on this issue,0,0,0,0,0,0

candelabra hypothesis sorry i wa away for a while just saw your comment the term candelabra wa coined by william white howells mankind in the making 1959 to describe coon s view of the origin of the race it completely incorrect but nonetheless the only term which ha ever been used to describe coon s evolutionary model it incorrect because howell s misinterpretated weidenreich s polycentric multiregional origin of the race which actually includes large amount of gene flow regional interbreeding when he wrongly believed it wa a parallel polygenic model of the race however coon stressed far le on this gene flow but still allowed for it so basically neither weidenreich nor coon s multiregionalism is true parallel or polygenic evolution however coon s model come far closer to it a his model doesn t take much interbreeding into account his geneflow is very minimal wiley blackwell encyclopedia of human evolution pp 114 115 see on google book ha a full discussion pointing all this out coon also believed the racial development and split were long before sapienization and that they were present in archaic homo and even earlier if you read his racial adaptation 1982 he briefly discus his idea that the australopithecine s were already split into the race for example he see mongoloid dental trait in one regional variation however true polyphyletic or polygenism model on the origin of the race died out in the late 19th century karl vogt for example argued the different race were never at any one point related and that they evolved from different primate,0,0,0,0,0,0

revisiting neutrality on the clinton entry i edited some content about the richard mellon scape adversarial relationship with clinton that dogged his career for 8 year and even after he left office many of the controversy raised during clinton s term were a direct result of the scape arkansas project and to see any reference to richard mellon scape s part in clinton s trouble just disappear seems like a very right wing view sanitization of the wikipedia a the arguably most important adversary of clinton for a lengthy portion of clinton s political career to obliterate any mention of this relationship come close to censorship r m scape is one of two very large and looming force at work in american politics in the early 21st century the other being george soros on the left their fingerprint from behind the curtain certainly draw analogy to the wizard s of oz please note that i did not vote for clinton either time being somewhat more conservative but i have noticed an apparent right shifted bias developing in area that touch upon politically related item in the wikipedia lately and it ain t good a they say this slow erosion of complete disclosure concerning what is stylized a right wing leaning viewpoint and the retention of those thing which critisize left wing leaning viewpoint is subtle but steady not just here but across many place on the wikipedia while they make me smile sometimes my inclination toward keeping wikipedia neutral rein in my mirth i would encourage the group to rethink the neutrality of wikipedia work very hard to balance the influence on both side to prevent any more of this shading of the wikipedia i know it is very hard to remain absolutely objective but it is imperative that we do so in order to remain a respected source to remain completely factual without opinionated bias it seems to me wikipedia should error on the side of inclusion rather than exclusion idiot savant i4 06 51 cdst 11 august 2006,0,0,0,0,0,0

this is actually a quite controversial case though i admit that the label belgian is a little misleading trappist quadrupel is not so bad stan heironymous in his very well researched book on belgian brewing brew like a monk writes about la trappe which wa briefly a trappist brewery in the netherlands and had the appellation revoked when it sold to a dutch brewing company according to those that sold the problem wa simply maintaining an order of monk they did produce a beer which they called a quadrupel moreover quadrupel ha become a label on some american beer obviously of belgian inspiration and using derivative of trappist yeast while this arguably make quadrupel not a style quadrupel is not listed a a style per say but one of the myriad specialized belgian ale i really find your argument unconvincing since the style guideline make it clear that this category is to be used for submitting to beer competition with a beer that is not appropriately labeled a something else which is to say that the style category is quite upfront about what it is and not misleading at all yes the bjcp style include some catch all category that aren t rightly considered style but they are clear about it when a judging category doesn t not fit some historically entrenched approach to beer since the guideline are very clear about what they are but also provide a lot of accurate information to the reader i think they re great indeed i would appriciate it if those that object would show me where the bjcp contradicts the opinion of other group on these subject,0,0,0,0,0,0

let s cut the hype and make this a better article the lead say she is currently the youngest individual to sail non stop and unassisted around the world that is an ambiguous statement somewhere documented around the time of kay cottee s circumnavigation there were three condition laid down for circumnavigation 1 pas through all meridian of longitude 2 travel some distance through both hemisphere 3 pas through two antipodean point kay cottee fulfilled only the first two and it now appears that jessica watson ha done the same thus she ha not fulfilled all three condition and that should be in the statement if you include all three the statement is wrong if the first two only it is right the issue of the record is a major controversy record for youngest are no longer recognised both in international sailing and by other body such a the guinness book of record this is for the obvious reason of not wanting to encourage attempt by people far too young to do it safely she also did not travel far enough to satisfy formal requirement for around the word the circumference of the earth is around 40 000km she travelled around 26 000km someone ha suggested that her trip might more accurately albeit outrageously be described a circumnavigating antarctica accurate and very demeaning she did a lot more than circumnavigate antarctica a i see it quoting the three condition above and saying that she fulfilled the first two only is the most accurate way that i can think of the source for that lead statement quickly address those issue the lead must be softened to reflect them those wanting to publicise how well she ha done should record her actual achievement distance age time etc but because of the obvious doubt stop insisting that it is a record that is simply reflecting medium hype and obvious pov what if it is the majority pov i concur that reference to a record should not be there but really amongst the knowledgeable sailor this isn t a record she herself said a much during the interview yesterday saying it wa never about that her grandfather admitted it on 7 news a few night ago and most of the daily paper are reporting it a no record officially it isn t a record unofficially she failed to meet the requirments a far a i can see the only people reporting it a a record are pr type and some medium saying she is the youngest to sail around the world is wrong jesse martin hold the only recognised record and the fact that jessica sailed le than 21 600nm also disqualifies her the last section on youth circumnavigators should say jesse martin i disagree there are other definition for circumnavigation than all three condition i mentioned above eg just taking the first two kay cottee did well with just those two so long a the word circumnavigation is qualified i see no problem in using it this is what wa reported in the medium yesterday regarding the voyage ninemsn when jessica watson sail into sydney harbour after her round the world sea voyage this month she won t be breaking any world record that depends on the definition of record she ha done something that nobody a young a she is ha done that could qualify a a record although not an official record the smh after the trip smh may 16 a world record a youngest to circumnavigate the globe it s now well established that she didn t achieve that according to the strict guideline laid down by the world sailing speed record council it seems to me it is now well known she didn t quite meet the rule she met two of the three rule and a such she should be accorded that achievement true the wssrc and the guinness book of record don t want to know that she s the youngest to do that but others might anybody else,0,0,0,0,0,0

di stefano ha no conviction and that wa made clear and conceded by the cps at the van hoogstraten hearing in 2002 he is a man of good character according to the transcript the crown did not challenge that at all because once a conviction is quashed one becomes again of good character and in any court of law one is not permitted to mention a conviction that wa subsequently quashed we have seen his certificate in italy that he is of no previous conviction and not under investigation we have been in touch under the freedom of information with the department of justice in washington and di stefano ha never been charged tried or convicted of either a felony or misdemenour in the u in fact in iraq he is protected more than any other person by the u military he is permitted incredible access to document and detainee including so called high risk terrorist which if he wa anything other than what he state he is would simply not be possible we have not quite understood actually who or what di stefano doe but he ha been involved in a number of situation which people end up either dead jailed and he continues his work there will be a book on his life published in italy unauthorised which may shed light on many aspect but to say he is anything other than of good character and a lawyer will only detract from the real object of discovering who or what he actually doe,0,0,0,0,0,0

hahaha check this out mickmacnee an editor with a long history of block for disruptive behaviour 10 seems to have gone out of line in the last day i don t mind him being defensive of an article he ha written the major part about and several user in the afd discussion have been very much engaged in it including myself however i object to the repated personal attack and uncivil behaviour by the editor his history is rather long so i provide just a few selected diffs of uncivil comment and direct personal attack during the last day 11 12 13 14 in the discussion on this page about a third user he call my argument for not agreeing with him evasion obfuscation interuption and intentional deafness that is rather typical of his attitude in the afd discussion where he agressively drive that everybody disagreeing with him are wrong i ve tried to point it out to him 15 but with hindsight given our infected history it might have been better not to a i should have predicted how he would respond 16 however i m far from alone in having that opinion in the last day several other editor have also commented on his behaviour 17 18 19 20 jeppiz talk that block log look like something out of a wiki horror story why ha he not been given long block in the past i would go for a longer term block ks0stm t c g a user block log is not generally an excuse to throw the book at him this look a bit silly if you ask me a bit of a tit for tat heated discussion over a article for deletion discussion that is split down the middle and nothing will come of it i can t find a really uncivil comment perhaps if you guy just edit different article for a few day off2riorob talk it go without saying that everybody ha different opinion but i do think that one of the nastiest and most repugnant editor either your comment wa simply ignorant of the fact like you characterisation of my pov or you are simply trolling either way you are all out of credit here tbh i ve got no idea what crappy paper you read it s up to you if you want to parrot everybody s delete opinion a if it make you look like you know what you are on about but it really doesn t are not particularly civil neither is i have had it with your crap in any case i won t interact with the user again i rather leave wikipedia a i pointed out i m far from alone in having made these observation jeppiz talk off2riorob i tried your suggestion in fact i didn t think i d need to try i didn t think i d cross path with mick after this bout of abuse but sure enough i did and when i reported him for violation of a 1r measure in place on the northern ireland article half of his defence wa an assumption of bad faith against me i guess if someone keep an eye on him he can t get too far out of hand alastairward talk it is a bit of a rant he is clearly very upset about the footie and i am sorry you have been upset jeppiz he ha gone now probably off to bed i m sure one of the admins will have a strong word in his ear when he show his face again i myself have had a run in with him but he ha grown on me what can i say off2riorob talk seeing the diffs alastairward provided i cannot agree even though i see that you stood up for him that time a well this is a user who seems unable to deal with conflicting view and routinely resort to personal abuse jeppiz talk nothing routine about it your behaviour and alistair s are pretty similar which is why they provoked similar response eventually if either of you wish me to lay out the full package of evidence for either of your extraordinarily sustained campaign of tendentious behaviour i am only too willing to oblige mickmacnee talk first of all alistair and i are not the only editor you ve attacked and insulted there are at least grsz 21 and kevin mce 22 just in the last few day while i have definitely argued with you i have not called you one of the most repugnant editor 23 called your contribution crap 24 called you a lying hypocritical cunt 25 or told you to fuck off 26 27 every time someone brings your behaviour to the attention of administrator you come up with these vague and unsupported accusation that one you ve argued with have behaved in the same way it is not a defense then both should be blocked and it s not true either just a dishonest way for you to try to talk you out of it i m getting tired of having that same accusation thrown at me all the time and i take it a,0,0,1,0,0,0

thank you i just tried logging in to this account and it worked although i did not intentionally reactivate this id like bwilkins repeatedly asserted i did not know about the existence of sandbox to build the article before publishing in fact no one ha mentioned it in all this discussion over the past one day and i discovered it myself accidentally midway through all this i wa only going to use the userpage a a starting point for a spoof page since i liked that one i wa not going to use the joke or even any of the material maybe if wikipedia wasn t too geeky or programmer language like to write article in i may not have needed a template and used just the wysiwyg editor and be done with it but that is not the case anyway what i don t understand is why one cannot get outraged by offending behavior you have acknowledged it wa wrong to have a label slapped on by the other editor without speaking to me or bothering to enlighten me he clearly wa more intent on getting brownie point a an editor or whatever it is that get people here high however everyone else seems intent on labeling me a a troll is that the high handed way of dealing with uncomfortable thing around here wouldn t they all be offended and outraged in real life if they were trying to make a cake and someone slapped a pink sheet on top of it and squashed it and walked off without an explanation,0,0,0,0,0,0

the general significance of m chopra s op ed and the specific significance of her nytimes op ed the nytimes recently published an op ed by m chopra i updated this article to include brief coverage of that op ed another contributor replaced that coverage with a briefer and imo inaccurate one sentence summary i asked them to explain their rewrite and they asserted her opinion column at most need a one line description so naming the reference ha no purpose i am concerned that this assertion implies the opinion it asserts is so obvious it doe not require any explanation i don t agree so how significant are op ed m chopra writes in general are op ed m chopra writies for the nytimes a significant a her other op ed or more significant this article could mainly focus on m chopra a just a pretty face where her opinion are of secondary importance there is the story of the young u celebrity who after a tour of the white house stated her admiration of it decor and congratulated the secretary of the interior i have no problem with article on unintelligent or inarticulate people which do not focus on their opinion but m chopra is clearly an intelligent person who ha volunteered to serve a an articulate spokesperson for the cause she belief in i suggest this mean that the best article on her would devote more than a single sentence to op ed that are well written and published in prominent newspaper or magazine in this particular case the replacement sentence wasn t even an accurate summary a it said that m chopra s op ed in december 2014 she wrote a column in the new york time on the importance of educating the girl child while she did address the need to bring effort to educate girl up to the same standard a boy she also advocated making the same effort to provide health care to girl a boy and she addressed the widely held disregard parent in the region feel for their daughter and their general preferential treatment of their son if the coverage of the nytimes op ed is going to be rewritten i call for it to be rewritten more carefully and accurately,0,0,0,0,0,0

dry sex edit in january 2013 i have copied the following comment from my talk page to here so that other interested editor may be more likely to see it and to add to any discussion this edit wa along time ago and i had totally forgotten about it i think that the part you are referring to wa when i changed the phrase the rationale for the practice is that a dry vagina is tighter than a lubricated vagina to the rationale for the practice seems to be for cleansing purpose i imagine that i made this change because the abstract of the cited source say the men described the use of drying agent by woman for vaginal cleansing purpose the practice referred to in the article text is described there a removing vaginal lubrication in some way having read it all again i must say that i am still at a bit of a loss perhaps you could be more specific a to where i went wrong in summarising that source maybe you could suggest better wording for that sentence,0,0,0,0,0,0

hi danimations i have some suggestion firstly the inclusion of section about role and origin and history or maybe history and achievement would be helpful a possible source of information is the six annual report for the premier s climate change council which can be downloaded from the dewnr website just paste premier s climate change council into the search box on the home page secondly with respect to the membership section content explaining from what sector of the community the member are sourced from should be added also the dot point list should be converted into a paragraph of name in alphabetical order with the word chair after the person who currently ha this responsibility i suggest this for two reason firstly the list do dominate the article and secondly a the article doe not appear to be intended to be a list a per wp guidance i will have a look again early tomorrow morning regard,0,0,0,0,0,0
my reverting of the edit in the history section i didn t revert the edit because the material you removed isn t redundant in some way which is fairly obvious if you read the section a a whole the entire history section of this article is still in very bad shape in my opinion i d suggest that it got non npov issue in several spot the tone it s written in and choice of word seem somewhat chatty and unencyclopedic to me and worst of all it continues to contain what i d argue are historical inaccuracy in some place instead of editing out the paragraph that wa removed today which contained a link to a map a well a an internal link to the ongoing caledonia land dispute a subject quite relevant in the grand valley these day i d like to see the entire history section itself brought up to a higher standard in my opinion from a historical perspective the article itself would benefit more if some of the earlier comment in it regarding the acquisition of the land by the six nation were edited out and replaced by the material that wa removed today a i said back in august i m willing to work on this article myself a time allows but in my opinion it doesn t make sense removing content that s not only relevant and contains reference it s actually of a higher quality than what remains,0,0,0,0,0,0

importance of this dispute i think that when you have a subject a ideologically charged a this one where the accusation and counter accusation are equally the product of political sympathy and ideological proclivity the contestation of fact itself becomes more significant and relevant then the normative preference i e an imaginary idea of a clear defined and uncontested truth not to suggest at all that all claim are thus equally valid but even if some of the claim have been manipulated to suit a particular agenda it is better that they lie ugly contested unsubstantiated and disempowered it is a better reflection of the nature of this topic in my mind it is irresponsible to try and figure out a depoliticized version of this issue a wikipedia editor are often compelled to do preceding unsigned comment added by 85 97 118 71,0,0,0,0,0,0

protected mode and long mode protected mode wa first introduced in intel 80286 providing mechanism protecting resource and assisting multi task o such a unix o 2 and so forth and enhanced in intel 80386 processor by extending computing capability to 32 bit from 16 bit eventually becomes part of ia 32 architecture most x86 o only running within protectected mode such a window nt linux and so many bsd distros but m do working under real mode some extender might switch through and back from protected mode for extending physical memory addressing likewise window 3 x also transit itself from real mode and protected mode thorugh and ack too window 9x not only depends the real mode a bootstrap but also sits itself from and to that mode long mode is a kind of protected mode not a real mode but doe not belong to the protected mode in ia 32 switch itself out of ia 32 dominated legacy mode to a completely self contained mode which mean even though a x64 processor eliminates it legacy part it would be fulfunctioned from the aspect of implementation or microarchitecture level the legacy mode code could share the same physical execution resource designed for the x64 code without needing additional physical execution unit for itself like it found in early itanium processor so ia 32 architecture might or might not have relationship with x86 64 x64 amd64 or intel64 ia32e and amd64 amd64 is a switched out architecture from ia 32 providing compatibility mode to support most ia 32 software and representing itself in the long mode within amd64 processor it is a new architecture even though most lying on ia 32 architecture ia32e is not a mode but an extention of ia 32 or newer revision of ia 32 introducing 64 bit computing capability for it fundemental architecture intel em64t is the new brought feature to this kind of processor enabling it for 64 bit computing of course em64t is not a mode too but a feature like pae could be enabled to extend the 64 bit computing capability without em64t enabled yamhill processor would act like a tradtional pentium 4 after em64t enabled 64 bit register would be visible to application 32 bit traditional o might need minor fix to support application referring 64 bit register to do the 64 bit computing but programmer must take care of the computing result without intervented by other process but most likely a it in pae o might need a patch to support this feature totally at least to manage the extended descriptor and extended 64 bit register and stack and so forth but without needing to compile the o from the scratch like it in amd64 virtual address might be extended up to 52 bit while physical address up to 46 bit 16k segment of 4gib could be spreaded to 64tib physical space with or without paging because the difference between 32bit and 64bit computing is bit width of register rather than the whole system so 32 bit and 64 bit code is also differentiated by the referenced resgistered without needing a submode such a compatibility mode to support tradtional 32 bit software after em64t disabled yamhill processor would act like a northwood pentium 4,0,0,0,0,0,0

i am glad you are working on a rewrite and i will be glad to help out there are 2 problem i see with what you are doing so far one is that you really can t tell this story without a little historical context and in particular you can t leave out morgan and the fruit fly work and the change in the perception of what mutation wa and how it affected the genetic variability of the populstion from the idea of the earlier mendalians such a de vries so at some point something about it ha to go back in the other is that most modern historian of science larson bowler gould treat the foundation of population genetics a the start gould call it the first phase of the modern synthesis not part of the run up to it i realize this view differs somewhat from the view of mayr who emphasizes more the later part of the synthesis that involved the integration of other field of biology with population genetics a the actual synthesis but on this point i think the article need to follow the view of most current historian of science rather than those of mayr or the other participant there is a reason why historian do not rely exclusively on first person account of the participant in an event and the biggest ha to do with perspective hopefully we can resolve these issue with compromise inline with the best tradition of wikipedia rather than the worst tradition of wikipedia edit warring,0,0,0,0,0,0

redirection of chris conley sorry to bother you again on your wikibreak but it seems that the dispute over the redirection of chris conley still ha not been resolved it seems that while i wa blocked ha redirected the article comment were left in regard to the redirect on the page save the day and another editor ha reverted the article which ha redirected again citing sockpuppetry and coi but failing to leave any kind of comment on the relevant discussion page a i wa blocked from editing i fail to understand how this could be the case and a quick whois search show that the editing ip s come from manchester uk and somewhere in australia so it appears that an edit war is still continuing rather than participate further in this and get blocked again i thought wa best to leave you a note here fyi the main reason why i redirected the article in the first place is because chris conley is also a successful touring solo artist a quick google search can confirm this and hence notable enough to warrent his own article i also find it interesting that a number of other editor have contributed to the article after i undid the original redirect on july 28 thanks and sorry again for dragging you outof your wikibreak,0,0,0,0,0,0

some pro life group the intro say some pro life group define pregnancy a beginning with fertilization and consider those form of ec that act after fertilization to be abortifacient i don t think that is an accurate paraphrase of the usual pro life position and it suggests four question 1 why is the word pregnancy used here pro lifer generally say that human life not pregnancy begin at fertilization the closest pro life statement that i can recall seeing to pregnancy begin with fertilization wa a bumper sticker that said if it s not a baby you re not pregnant the problem with substituting the word pregnancy for the phrase human life is that it is unclear how that applies to human embryo conceived in a laboratory 2 why is the word define used instead of believe or contend word are defined natural process can be discovered or understood but not defined the pro life argument is not about grammar 3 some pro life group i thought all pro lifer believed that human life begin at fertilization what pro life group do not contend that human life begin with fertilization are there any 4 what form of ec do not act after fertilization i don t know the answer to question 2 but i am pretty sure that most if not all pro life group consider human life to begin at fertilization can anyone name an exception i m also certain that all form of ec act after fertilization at least some of the time and therefore work a abortifacient correct me if i m wrong doe anyone know of a form of ec that doesn t i suggest that we change the sentence to say pro life group contend that human life begin with fertilization and consider ec to be an abortifacient when it block implantation of a fertilized ovum,0,0,0,0,0,0

like i have said countless time over today s mulatto movement or internet mulatto movement lol for lack of a better phrase draw all it esteem from the counterproductive denigration of black people and nothing else i put black in quote because in the united state mulatto and black aren t necessarily mutually exclusive concept i will go a far to say any power self identifying mulatto have or hope to have will always be in relation to black people but what these mulatto fail to realize is that their very existence promotes race mixing or encouraging 6 8 mandingo date marry and impregnate 5 3 mary sue which white no matter how much you cozy up to them and try to delink yourself from black will innately reject and perennially frown upon i am sure there are black mulatto men who would take advantage of the mulatto movement to sleep with a many white woman a possible white woman who were not accessible before interestingly people at the helm of the mulatto movement more than likely turn out to be quadroon or octoroon it s fascinating because there is a hierarchical paradigm that is followed and what s funny is that i can imagine hexadecaroon s forming a quadroon movement that not only denigrated black people but mulatto people a well you gotta love this stuff lol,0,0,0,0,0,0

article need to be split into two there are two different thing going on in this article one is a hypothetical discussion of what a north american currency union might look like based on description in obscure white paper from think tank and science fiction book the other is the origin and debunking of the conspiracy theory that such a union actually is being planned by some sort of powerful force the two have little to do with each other for one additionally by keeping the two in one article the citation for the first look like evidence for the latterwhich they are not and which some of the people who provide them probably do not want them used a the first article should be the place for discussing serious economic and futurologist viewpoint about what an nacu might be the second should be devoted largely to a sociological analysis of why people believe in the conspiracy theorynot to detail of the theory itself a that lends undue weight to the idea that said theory is true i suggest that the two article be north american currency union concept in literature and north american currency union conspiracy theory,0,0,0,0,0,0

i am removing the following section for two reason some anthropologist and sociologist are critical of the method because it measure personality trait on a basis of it synonymous adjective in the english language thus overlooking possible cultural construction of language that english alone wa used in factor analysis also arguably demonstrates an example of ethnocentrism furthermore sociologist are critical that the theory only reinforces stereotype and ignores social factor that might have lead to trait being present in certain group of individual for instance while woman have a demonstrated tendency towards agreeableness this is likely true of most subordinated individual tying this trait to woman at a psychological level then only reasserts inequality by implying that difference exist a a matter of human nature rather than a a result of the social construction of gender 1 the information given there is incorrect i ve checked the scientific research to be sure and english alone wa not used in factor analysis and the existence and nature of the big five factor ha been validated in multiple continent here s an excerpt from mccrae hofstede s fascinating paper personality and culture revisited linking trait and dimension of culture 2004 research in the english speaking world using the neo pi r established that individual difference in the factor are stable throughout most of the adult life span that self report generally agree with observer rating and that the five factor a well a the more specific trait that define them are strongly heritable in the 1990s researcher around the world began to develop translation 2 of the instrument making cross cultural research possible a series of study showed that much the same factor structure wa found in a wide variety of culture mccrae costa 1997 that developmental trend in the mean level of personality trait between adolescence and later adulthood appeared to be universal mccrae et al 1999 and that similar gender difference were found among culture costa terracciano mccrae 2001 here are the relevant citation from the above if you can find them i suggest taking a look mccrae r r costa p t jr 1997 personality trait structure a a human universal american psychologist 52 509 516 mccrae r r costa p t jr lima m p simões a ostendorf f angleitner a et al 1999 age difference in personality across the adult life span parallel in five culture developmental psychology 35 466 477 costa p t jr terracciano a mccrae r r 2001 gender difference in personality trait across culture robust and surprising finding journal of personality and social psychology 81 322 331 a a further note in this regard one group of subordinated individual prisoner show personality profile with low agreeableness score teenager also show lower agreeableness than adult so i don t think it s likely true of most subordinated individual that they have high agreeableness in point of fact it appears that extroversion actually ha more to do with social dominance than agreeableness doe and men score higher in the assertiveness sub scale of extroversion incidentally a given in the last study cited above 2 beyond being incorrect i don t like the above statement because it demonstrates bias the fact that psychometric research reinforces stereotype doe not show that the research is bad or wrong instead it support the truth to these stereotype whether woman are agreeable because of genetic or environmental reason is irrelevant to the question of whether agreeableness is a valid and universal psychomentric construct and of course while sociologist and anthropologist may be unhappy about these research result that doesn t change the fact hopefully this explanation is thorough enough to obviate the necessity of future argument 22 26 25 apr 2005 utc clearly the point is biased in some direction it is after all called criticism however it is appreciatable to rework claim rather than remove them entirely a for example my move to redirect back the bias of your word discovered implying a factual truth of the matter back to the more neutral term identified and my return of your loaded attempt of beginning the criticism section with while the general consensus favoring a five factor model is strong there is still dissention and how wa the big five originally constructed if not through factor analysis of personality trait from the english dictionary that s what i had read if later attempt were made to see if othe,0,0,0,0,0,0

i ve been including date in the other appearance for two reason first because there are four monster manual three fiend folio three draconomicons two forgotten realm campaign setting two monster manual ii etc and date are an easy way to distinguish those and second because i thought it might be useful for people to be able to easily tell which appearance came first i wouldn t include date outside of that column unless i wa referencing one of the repeat name product you are dead right about the product code frx1 and frb1 were internal tsr code assigned to those product but never used on the product themselves and tsr didn t assign code to everything i have only included the code when they were actually printed on the sourcebook but even that isn t always helpful rr6 is mislabeled rs1 for example i m happy to drop the code entirely from the cross referencing and perhaps only mention them under the main entry for that product i m not sure if we should be including the name of the campaign setting a part of the product in most case the campaign setting wasn t part of the official product title golden voyage for example appears in the 1992 tsr catalog a alq1 golden voyage heading and just golden voyage in the descriptive text rather than al qadim golden voyage again however there are exception to this such a the 1993 forgotten realm campaign setting given how frequently the product title appear in the other appearance column i suspect that the best strategy might be to keep the title a simple a possible i e just golden voyage and not al qadim golden voyage or alq1 golden voyage it shouldn t be too hard for someone to do a search for that title and a the list of monster are expanded those title can be linked to monster listing for the cross referenced product so i think my proposal for a standard would be no product code no campaign setting but the year included at least for the other appearance reference i m ambivalent about the italic but tending towards worrying about those when link to those product monster list are added,0,0,0,0,0,0

hi aoystreck thanks for contributing to helping make this article better spelling and grammar notably though and apostrophe s i spell checked the entire article and i think that i corrected all the spelling mistake and the apostrophe spoliers i m undecided on what to do for this problem i do agree that saying to much about scene being filmed is a give away but i think that occasionally mentioning what type of a scene is being filmed should be noted for example mentioning when and where they filmed scene s with what cast member and occasionally mention a notable set up or notable scene being filmed plot summary i m not sure if you cited this a a problem but think that the plot section ha a reasonable amount of information and plot point throughout the development and writing section because both cast and crew released this information to the public domain via interview statement etc so i think that it should be mention because if the information wasn t suppose to be known then they wouldn t have stated it you also said that these three problem are among others if you could could you please cite other problem with this page so that i could fix them,0,0,0,0,0,0

the pub having just visited the pub i would like to point out that it most certainly is notable probably not in any way that would be recognised by wikipedia but for aficionado of british pub it is well worth seeking out open evening only by the way is there any authority for it once being named the mermaid s rest it seems most unlikely and the current landlord made no mention of it although he wa uncertain which if any of a number of possible origin for the name of anchor is correct there seems no doubt that the pub gave the hamlet it name,0,0,0,0,0,0

nice to meet you 92 xx you ask some very good question i ll be glad to answer them one of my great passion in life is learning about a broad variety of different topic computer science physic in a general sense world history geography biological life etc but above all else i am extremely passionate about human right in the most general sense i support freedom for everyone regardless of their life situation with regard to most of the cause that i support not only have i taken the time to read about them on the side but i ve also followed news development pertaining to them very closely for example i oppose the ruling family of saudi arabia because of their hardline islamist ideology and authoritarian method to start with i consider saudi arabia guilty of gender apartheid against it woman who aren t even allowed to leave the house without wearing an abaya and being in the company of a male consort it s the only country in the world where woman are not permitted to drive they are also known for severely discriminating against expatriate worker from throughout asia and africa abuse against the shiite community in the eastern province and publicly beheading people for nonviolent offence they literally still perform execution on charge of witchcraft and sorcery and that s just the tip of the iceberg in a laundry list of reason why i detest the saudi monarchy what make it worse is the fact that there doesn t seem to be any outrage over their human right record which deeply trouble me granted i don t think saudi arabia is a controversial state to denounce some of the one i ve listed are no brainers to most people a free burma the end of totalitarianism in north korea etc but then there s the more divisive issue such a kosovar independence or the syrian civil war i have been following the latter since before the uprising even began in march 2011 already very familiar with the human right situation in syria i wa fully anticipating the arab spring to arrive there sooner or later i also knew it would be far more complicated than any other arab country if for no other reason than for the fact that it ha a society divided along sectarian line i support the downfall of bashar al assad i believe that he and his regime have committed large scale crime against humanity for the sake of retaining power yes i do think he deployed sarin gas in ghouta however unlike many others i do not see opposition to assad a being mutually exclusive from opposition to al qaeda and it affiliate including it syrian branch al nusra they too have committed atrocity specifically against the christian and alawites the long and short of it is i support a free democratic and secular syria easier said than done but it never hurt to be optimistic now kosovo is an entirely different story the region ha a very complicated history especially during the existence of yugoslavia a an independent state i ll spare you the lengthy explanation of the context the situation after the breakup of yugoslavia the guerrilla war conducted by the terroristic kosovo liberation army against ethnic serb the resulting ethnic cleansing campaign against the kosovar albanian conducted by the regime of slobodan milosevic the un presence in kosovo the 2008 declaration of independence etc all you need to know a it pertains to my support of kosovar independence is the fact that the vast majority of people in kosovo support it everything else is immaterial to me it s what the people want that i care about the issue of kosovar serb should be resolved through negotiation between serbia and kosovo those are just two example of my le popular stance asperger s syndrome is considered a pervasive developmental disorder on the autism spectrum at it most basic you could say it is simply a mind form of autism but that in itself would be a drastic oversimplification of what is a very unique condition every case is different and i have a particularly mild diagnosis most people would never guess that there wa anything different about me it s more in the negative way that i would oftentimes interpret subtle nuance of socialization for example if i overheard two people having a conversation and discerned my name i d get nervous and assume that,0,0,0,0,0,0
